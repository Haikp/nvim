# My NVim Configs
This repo is from the primeagen, which I'm slowly modifying it to fit my needs. I've had this config for a while now, but now that I've made a decent amount of changes to the remapping, I believe that I should write something to track my changes for myself. I am no expert in nvim nor lua, just trying to make some shortcuts to the development process.

##CMake Adjustments
Something that I'm currently trying to do with CMake is define a structure that I want to follow, and I want to automate and make the whole testing process more dynamic to accomodate my crazy ideas for the "pitchfork" cmake organization. As a tldr, I wanted to be able to compile, make, and run dynamically based on the pwd. Using dispatch, the cwd is defaulted, and such i made some remaps and changes to CMakeLists.txt to try and make things more easier without having to quit vim repeatedly to compile the correct project. As though I now depend on pwd, I still do use cwd to establish all the builds that will happen for the multiple projects. At first I wanted to have everything rely on pwd searching for the nearest CMakeLists.txt, however I just imaged the amount of build folders just litered around, and I decided to have some consistency in that regard. Perhaps I will revert back to that eventually seeing that its not that bad to have all these build folders, but for now I just want to test this organization method.
